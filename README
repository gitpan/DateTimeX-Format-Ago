NAME
    DateTimeX::Format::Ago - I should have written this module "3 years ago"

SYNOPSIS
      my $then = DateTime->now->subtract(days => 3);
      say DateTimeX::Format::Ago->format_datetime($then); # "3 days ago"

DESCRIPTION
    Ever wished DateTime::Format::Natural had a "format_datetime" method?
    This module provides human-friendly datetime formatting, outputting
    strings like "3 days ago".

    Primary use case: websites that show a list of a person's recent
    activities.

  Constructor
    "new(language => $lang)"
        Creates a formatter object for the given language (a BCP47 language
        code). If the language is omitted, extracts it from $ENV{LANG}.

        Decent English ('en'), German ('de') and French ('fr') support is
        provided. Portuguese ('pt') and Castillian Spanish ('es') are also
        provided, but some of the strings were translated with Google
        Translate, so they might not be perfect.

  Methods
    "format_datetime($dt)"
        Returns something like "3 days ago", "just now" or "hace un a√±o".

    "parse_datetime($string)"
        Croaks. Don't use this.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=DateTimeX-Format-Ago>.

    I'm actively seeking translations. Feel free to attach patches for other
    languages as bug reports.
